PPBBS
=====

WoW addon for Papapaint's Bodybag Squad

Functionality:

- Respond to !ppbbs commands in raid chat
- '!ppbbs' alone posts a recap for the entire tier
- '!ppbbs [name]' posts a string announcing that players bodybag count, if that player is registered to the roster
- '!ppbbs add' will register the targeted player to the BBS roster, enabling death tracking

Enhancements:

- Implement a list of adjestives, superlatives, etc. in order to spice up the echoed text.
- Being insulted by the same addon using the same exact string time after time would quickly get old.
