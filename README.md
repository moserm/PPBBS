PPBBS
=====

WoW addon for Papapaint's Bodybag Squad

Functionality:

- Respond to !ppbbs commands in raid chat
- '!ppbbs' alone posts a recap for the entire tier
- '!ppbbs [name]' posts a string announcing that players bodybag count, if that player is registered to the roster
- '!ppbbs add [name]' will register that player to the BBS roster, enabling death tracking
- '!ppbbs register [name]' will register a boss to the list of raid bosses, enabling kill tracking

To-do list:

- Reimplement player and boss registration by player target.
- Use a single command '!ppbbs add' to add either a player to the player variable or a boss to the boss variable.
- The two can be distinguished by whether or not the target is friendly or hostile.

Enhancements:

- Implement a list of adjestives, superlatives, etc. in order to spice up the echoed text.
- Being insulted by the same addon using the same exact string time after time would quickly get old.
